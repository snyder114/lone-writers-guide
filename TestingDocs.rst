Getting docs tested

How to swim in the deep water - A lone writer’s guide to survival
=================================================================

Starting notes:
---------------

* Why should documentation be tested?  How is this different than a content review?
* Who should test it?
* How to implement a procedure where SMEs (developers, support) test the procedures/info in the docs?

Hack-a-thon content:
--------------------
Testing documentation is one of the most vital aspects of being a technical writer. Any written or pictorial information that describes procedures, requirements, or results should be thoroughly tested. Documentation is as important to a product’s success as the product itself. If the documentation is poor, non-existent, or wrong, it reflects on the quality of the product and the company. It can also cause major and costly problems down the line.

The documentation can be tested in a number of different ways to many different degrees of complexity. These range from running the documents through a spelling and grammar checker, to manually reviewing the documentation to remove any ambiguity or inconsistency.

Who can test the docs?
--------------------

It's best to get multiple pairs of eyes on your content, preferably from different area of the team and with varying degrees of expertise. 

* **You** - You should always be one of the first people to test your docs. Since you're the person who's most familiar with the content, you can focus on things like style, grammar, and spelling. Read through your docs several times and make sure they adhere to your company's style. Look for instances of the passive voice and future tense.

* **Engineers** - It's good to have the engineer who created the feature also test the documentation for that feature. They might have certain expectations about how the feature should be used, and you should make sure that those expectations align with the user's. 

* **QA/customer support** - QA engineers and customer support are great testing candidates because they often haven't seen the feature previously. They will have little to no prior expectations or knowledge, so they can go into the testing process with a clean slate. They will be good for pointing out any obvious holes in the documentation that you and the engineers may have missed. 

* **Field experts** - Field experts have a lot of contact with customers, and they have direct experience working on-site with the product. They can come from a different angle and bring a fresh perspective to doc testing. They often have recommendations for documentation that other testers would never think of.

* **PMs** - PMs are some of the best testing candidates. They have direct contact with customers, and they know specific use cases for how the feature will be used. They will be able to tell you if the documentation you have written will align with customer goals.

Define a test process
--------------------

Provide a specific test process for each of your testers to follow. This ensures that everyone has the same expectations.

For example, each tester should do the following:

* Perform a detailed walkthrough of assigned topics. Perform all steps/instructions as specified in the docs.

* Review topics for completeness; recommend improvements.

* Report errors/inaccuracies; provide specific fix. Add comments in the test plan.

After receiving feedback, you as the writer should facilitate testing and integrate fixes into the docs.

Assign specific topics/sections to each tester
--------------------

Don't just ask someone to "take a look" at your docs. In your test plan, make a table that clearly assigns different topics to different testers. Tell them what to focus on (the whole topic, a certain aspect of the topic, etc.) Tell them the resource requirements they'll need in order to test that portion of the doc (do they need a single instance of the product? A distributed deployment?) Give them a place to provide feedback and recommendations.

Use the following table as a starting point:

+------------+------------+-----------------------+----------+--------+-----------------------------+ 
| Topic      | Focus      | Resource Requirements | Assignee | Status | Fixes/Recommendations/Notes |
+============+============+=======================+==========+========+=============================+
|            |            |                       |          |        |                             |
+------------+------------+-----------------------+----------+--------+-----------------------------+
